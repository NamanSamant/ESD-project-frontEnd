## Project Overview

The **Organization Management System** enables users to manage organizations effectively. Key features include:
- **Create Organization**: Add new organizations to the system.
- **View Organizations**: See a list of all organizations in the system.
- **Search Organization**: Find specific organizations using filters or keywords.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login for accessing functionality.

## Flow and Control

The application follows a **component-driven structure** with clearly defined pages for specific tasks. Here's a high-level overview of the **flow and control**:

### 1. **App Initialization**
   - The application starts at the `index.js` entry point, where the `App` component is rendered.
   - Global styles (`index.css` and `App.css`) are applied, and the app initializes with Tailwind CSS configuration.

### 2. **Navigation and Routing**
   - Navigation and routing are handled through custom hooks in the `hooks/` directory.
   - Pages are organized in the `pages/` directory for clear route management.

### 3. **Authentication Flow**
   - Authentication logic is managed through custom hooks.
   - API configurations for authentication are stored in the `api/` directory.

### 4. **Core Functionality**
   - **Components**: Reusable UI components are stored in the `components/` directory.
   - **API Integration**: API calls are configured in the `api/` directory.
   - **Custom Hooks**: Business logic is separated into custom hooks in the `hooks/` directory.

### 5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - The `reportWebVitals.js` file is used to measure the performance of the app.
