## Project Overview

The **Organization Management System** enables users to manage organizations effectively. Key features include:
- **Create Organization**: Add new organizations to the system.
- **View Organizations**: See a list of all organizations in the system.
- **Search Organization**: Find specific organizations using filters or keywords.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login for accessing functionality.

## Flow and Control

The application follows a **component-driven structure** with clearly defined pages for specific tasks. Here’s a high-level overview of the **flow and control**:

### 1. **App Initialization**
   - The application starts at the `index.js` entry point, where the `App` component is rendered inside a React root element.
   - Global styles (`index.css` and `App.css`) are applied, and the app initializes with the necessary configurations, including Tailwind CSS.

### 2. **Navigation and Routing**
   - The **Navbar** component (`components/navbar.js`) provides navigation links to different pages like "Login," "Create Organization," and "View Organizations."
   - Routing is handled via React Router (assumed, though not visible in the structure), with paths leading to various pages in the `pages/` directory.

### 3. **Authentication Flow**
   - The `login.js` page serves as the entry point for authenticated users. It collects user credentials and validates them (presumably using APIs configured in `api/axios.js`).
   - Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the main dashboard or the "View Organizations" page.

### 4. **Core Functionality**
   - **Creating Organizations**:
     - The `CreateOrganization.js` page provides a form to input organization details.
     - On form submission, the data is sent to the backend via Axios (configured in `api/axios.js`) and stored in the database.
   - **Viewing Organizations**:
     - The `ViewOrganizations.js` page fetches and displays a list of all organizations. 
     - Organizations are displayed using the reusable `OrganizationCard.js` component for a consistent and modular UI.
   - **Searching for Organizations**:
     - The `SearchOrganization.js` page allows users to search through the list of organizations by name, type, or other criteria.
     - Search functionality is implemented using state management (e.g., React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks) and API calls.

### 5. **Modals and Other Components**
   - The `HrModal.js` component is used for displaying dynamic modals, such as for editing or confirming HR-related actions.

### 6. **Performance Monitoring**
   - The `reportWebVitals.js` file is used to measure the performance of the app and report metrics to improve user experience.
